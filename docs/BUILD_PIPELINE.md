# Build and Release Pipeline

The active `serp.software` and `pornvideodownloaders.com` applications are distinct
Next.js Workers built with `@opennextjs/cloudflare`. Each queries its own Cloudflare
D1 database at runtime. There is no JSON serving fallback and no GitHub Pages artifact
sync in either release path.

## Ownership

- `scripts/site-targets.ts`: exhaustive executable site and release identities.
- `sites/<site-id>/site-config.ts`: checked-in application configuration.
- `configs/wrangler/<site-id>/*.jsonc`: checked-in Worker and D1 binding templates.
- `packages/content/data/**/*.mdx`: file-authored documentation and legal content.
- `d1/drizzle/`: active Drizzle-generated D1 history for replacement databases;
  `d1/migrations/0001`-`0009` remains immutable retained-source history.
- `d1/artifacts/`: deterministic initial migration and parity evidence.
- `listing_submissions` and child tables: private, badge-gated public intake.
- `d1/publications/`: approved, versioned mutation manifests.
- `packages/data-ops/`: shared catalog DTOs, query SQL, hydration, caching contracts,
  and safe query telemetry for every current and future site.
- `apps/<site-id>/lib/catalog/`: thin server-only adapter that validates and supplies
  the site's explicit D1 binding and identity to `packages/data-ops/`; it owns no
  catalog SQL.

No catalog JSON inputs exist. Runtime, build, search, sitemap, RSS, and writer paths
must remain D1-only.

## Validate and build

```bash
pnpm worker:config:validate
pnpm test:d1
pnpm typecheck
pnpm worker:build
```

The OpenNext build emits one `.open-next/worker.js` and asset set under each app.
Both sites have separate local and production Wrangler identities and bindings.
Both also have separate Preview configuration and provisioned Preview resources;
SERP's protected source/replacement Preview path was rehearsed by Issue #72.
Configuration validation rejects cross-environment and cross-site references. Release tooling materializes
ignored environment-specific configuration
under `.wrangler/generated/` and rebases Worker, asset, schema, and migration paths
relative to that generated configuration.

Replacement templates are separate `replatform-*.jsonc` files and point only at
`d1/drizzle/`. Routine protected Preview and Production workflows select those
templates and replacement D1 secrets explicitly; the canonical templates remain for
the retained one-time recovery machinery. The inactive source databases stay locked
and retained through 2026-12-24. See [the replacement cutover contract](./D1_CUTOVER.md).

The completed one-time Production provisioner created only the exact empty replacement
D1 registered for each Site after proving account, source D1, Worker, placement, and
protected environment. It is now disabled; its retained identity receipts are
historical evidence and do not authorize another create or cutover.

## Protected production release

`main` is protected. Changes arrive through pull requests whose strict required
checks must pass on a revision current with `main`; conversations must be resolved,
and direct pushes, force pushes, and branch deletion are prohibited. The repository
does not require another approving reviewer because it has one Maintainer.

Merging a pull request triggers a read-only full-harness validation of the integrated
`main` revision. Production release remains manual after that merge; updating `main`
does not deploy a Worker. Use the site-specific protected workflow from the reviewed
`main` commit:

| Site | Workflow | Protected production environment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `serp.software` | `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml` | `production` |
| `pornvideodownloaders.com` | `deploy-pornvideodownloaders.yml` | `pornvideodownloaders-production` |

The dispatcher chooses:

- `worker-only` only when the reviewed commit requires no unapplied migration; or
- `database-and-worker` for a new migration, a possibly lagging database, or any case
  where compatibility cannot be established.

Both modes validate configuration, tests, types, and the Worker build. Immediately
before deployment, the guarded `check-schema` command reads applied migration names
from the exact remote target and fails closed if every checked-in migration cannot be
proven present. A Worker-only run performs no D1 mutation.

The database-and-Worker mode retains a D1 export, applies forward Drizzle migrations,
verifies schema compatibility, and only then deploys the OpenNext Worker. It does not
replay the initial catalog or require the active publication to remain at bootstrap
version 1. Initial import and exact bootstrap parity belong only to a new-site release
or separately reviewed migration. See
[the deploy runbook](./DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md) for release-mode selection, smoke coverage,
D1 analytics evidence, and rollback thresholds.

No production command is authorized from a dirty local worktree.

## Verified submission approval

Each public form writes normalized staging rows to its site's D1. Server-side badge
verification makes a submission reviewable but not public. A maintainer runs the
protected `approve-d1-submission.yml` workflow, which retains a backup and atomically
promotes only a verified row.

When enabled with a durable protected Cloudflare credential,
`notify-d1-submissions.yml` polls both active sites' badge-verified rows every five
minutes and creates an assigned issue in the private repository. It is currently
disabled as recorded in the deploy runbook. The D1 notification
ledger prevents duplicates and lets an interrupted issue-create/write sequence
recover by marker. The issue is closed only after the protected approval workflow
has successfully approved or declined the authoritative D1 row.

Maintainer-authored catalog changes still use a versioned manifest under
`d1/publications/` and `.github/workflows/publish-d1.yml`, with an explicit registered
site and that site's protected production environment.

The publisher enforces tenant identity, base version, prior checksum, record/category
invariants, stable IDs, idempotency, and audit rows. The next checksum is derived from
the reviewed manifest source rather than trusted caller input.

## Local D1 guard

All local D1 commands pass through `scripts/d1-local-guard.ts --site <site-id>`, which
resolves the registered local Worker name, database name, synthetic database ID,
config path, state directory, and `--local` flag. Convenience aliases select a site
explicitly. Local permission never authorizes preview or production access.
