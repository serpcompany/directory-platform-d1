# Visitor and discoverability capabilities

Status: inventory draft; release evidence contract not yet decided

Responsible area: product and release engineering

Validation: `pnpm docs:check`

This document inventories the behavior that `serp.software` and
`pornvideodownloaders.com` are expected to provide to a Visitor. It is the starting
point for a production confidence contract, not yet a claim that every capability is
proven in production or must block a release.

The governing vocabulary is in [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md). A Visitor is looking
for and evaluating tools without being expected to have technical knowledge.

## Evidence vocabulary

- **Implemented**: the enabled application and shared packages contain the behavior.
- **Locally automated**: a deterministic repository or browser test exercises the
  externally observable behavior against a local D1-backed Worker or a controlled
  boundary.
- **Live verified**: bounded read-only evidence demonstrates the behavior on both
  production Sites.
- **Unknown**: the inventory found no authoritative evidence at that level.

Implemented is not proof that a capability works. The release-blocking evidence
levels and thresholds remain decisions on the active GitHub Wayfinder map.

## Shared Site contract

Both Sites are expected to use the same shared behavior with an explicit Site
identity and separate D1 database. Site-specific names, domains, branding, social
links, catalog contents, category sets, and network links may differ. A capability
must not silently read another Site's data or infer a default Site.

| Capability | Expected Visitor outcome | Current repository evidence | Evidence gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Site identity | The page consistently represents the requested Site, domain, branding, and catalog. | Site registry and configuration are explicit; multisite smoke tests assert the selected Site heading, title, representative Listing, category, and exact catalog count. | Current live parity must be verified. |
| Home discovery | The home page loads a D1-derived catalog and exposes clear paths to browse and search. | Both apps use the shared home route with D1 data; multisite smoke tests assert a successful document and exact catalog count. | Complete live content and interaction behavior is not yet recorded. |
| Catalog browsing | A Visitor can scan Listings, see result counts, filter by category, and change ordering without losing the current state unexpectedly. | Public-parity browser tests cover result counts, category navigation, sorting, persistence after reload, and empty search state. | Coverage is concentrated in the pilot configuration and is not yet a release contract for both Sites. |
| Search | A Visitor can search from the home page, header, and search page and reach relevant Listing results. | Shared search UI and bounded D1 search API exist; browser tests cover form submission, autocomplete keyboard navigation, mobile search, result navigation, and empty states. | Relevance expectations, malformed-query behavior, and live results are not yet baselined. |
| Category discovery | Active D1 categories have indexable pages containing eligible Listings; nonexistent or empty categories do not masquerade as valid pages. | Category routes read D1, generate metadata and structured data, and call `notFound()` for missing or empty categories. Multisite smoke covers a representative category. | Every active category and its canonical/indexing state is not yet checked live. |
| Featured discovery | A featured category is available only when eligible featured Listings exist. | The featured route derives its data from D1 and returns not found when the featured count is zero. | No explicit browser assertion or live baseline currently proves this conditional behavior. |
| Listing evaluation | A Visitor can open a canonical Listing detail page and evaluate its summary, content, categories, media, resource links, FAQs, related Listings, and external destination when those fields exist. | Shared detail DTOs and route components exist; browser smoke covers a representative detail route, canonical metadata, structured data, and outbound-link semantics. | Optional-field combinations, media failure states, all structured-data fields, and live representative samples remain incomplete. |
| Listing redirects and absence | A retired Listing slug permanently redirects only to its reviewed canonical replacement; an unknown Listing returns not found. | Detail routes use the D1 redirect lookup before `notFound()`; repository tests cover redirect and catalog contracts. | Representative live redirect chains and final canonical URLs are not yet recorded. |
| Lightweight preferences | A Visitor can favorite Listings and retain supported search/sort preferences locally without an account. | Public-parity tests cover favorite toggling, favorites-only filtering, and sort persistence. | Dedicated `/favorites/` is intentionally disabled on both Sites; the supported scope and storage compatibility need explicit release assertions. |
| Mobile navigation | A Visitor can search, open and close navigation, follow category links, and use the catalog without viewport escape on a phone-sized screen. | Browser tests cover the mobile drawer, search overlay, body scroll locking, navigation, and document/hero containment. | Broader element-level containment and both-Site interaction coverage remain partial. |
| Static information | A Visitor can access enabled about and legal information with correct headings and metadata. | About and legal routes exist; basic browser coverage asserts the about page loads. Sitemap generation includes configured public static pages. | Content presence, metadata, canonicals, and indexing for every enabled static page are not comprehensively asserted. |
| Brands network | A Visitor can reach the enabled Brands surface without falling through to a retired origin. | `showBrands` is enabled for both Sites; the route is shared and visual coverage exists. | Current live origin, canonical, content, and link behavior require verification. |
| Creator entry point | A Creator can reach `/submit/` from Visitor-facing navigation without broken internal-link semantics. | Public-parity tests cover the Submit Yours link; the page loads active categories from D1. | The Creator journey is intentionally secondary to this Visitor-first contract. |
| Disabled surfaces | A Visitor does not encounter partially supported docs, guides, projects, account, login, or dedicated favorites experiences. | Both Site configurations disable auth, docs, favorites, guides, and projects; route feature gates return not found and noindex metadata where applied. | All disabled route families need a consistent route/status/indexing audit. |
| Error and empty states | Missing content, empty results, and recoverable failures are understandable and do not expose internal errors. | Browser tests cover empty search and a basic 404; shared Listing and form error surfaces exist. | D1 outage, malformed response, missing media, and unexpected server failure behavior are not covered as a coherent Visitor contract. |

## Technical discoverability contract

Technical discoverability is grouped with Visitor capabilities because it determines
whether Visitors can find the Sites. Rankings, impressions, and traffic are external
outcomes; this repository can only enforce the technical inputs it controls.

| Capability | Expected behavior | Current repository evidence | Evidence gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical URLs | Every indexable page declares the intended HTTPS Site URL; aliases and retired slugs resolve to it without loops. | Shared metadata helpers construct Site-bound canonicals; smoke tests assert a representative Listing canonical. | Route-wide and live canonical coverage is incomplete. |
| Robots directives | Public canonical pages are indexable and followable; private, disabled, error, and duplicate pages are not indexable. | Shared metadata supports index/follow and explicit noindex; `robots.ts` is present for both apps. | A route-by-route expected directive matrix and live verification do not yet exist. |
| Titles and descriptions | Every indexable page has Site-appropriate, nonempty metadata that describes its actual content. | Root, Listing, category, search, static, and legal metadata generators exist. | Uniqueness, length, content quality, and full live coverage are unproven. |
| Social previews | Indexable pages expose correct Open Graph and Twitter metadata using Site-owned images and URLs. | Shared metadata generates Open Graph and Twitter fields; PVD has checked-in branded assets. | Asset validity, SERP fallback quality, dimensions, and live response coverage are unknown. |
| Structured data | Structured data represents the visible Site, breadcrumbs, categories, and Listings without appearing on private or nonexistent content. | Home, category, and Listing routes render JSON-LD; smoke tests assert its presence on a representative Listing; private Submission preview suppresses Listing structured data. | Schema validity and agreement with visible/live content are not comprehensively tested. |
| Sitemap discovery | `/robots.txt` points crawlers to the canonical sitemap index, and the index exposes only enabled sitemap groups. | Shared sitemap code builds Site-bound XML; multisite smoke asserts D1 Listing counts, category membership, and feed responses. | Live index membership, status, content type, canonical host, last-modified policy, and excluded routes need a complete baseline. |
| Sitemap eligibility | Sitemaps contain only approved, active, published D1 Listings and active categories, with no disabled or duplicate route surfaces. | D1 query predicates and sitemap builders encode eligibility; `/products/` is explicitly excluded because it redirects to home. | Exact live URL sets and indexability agreement are not yet continuously proven. |
| Feed discovery | The public feed contains eligible D1 Listings, correct Site identity, stable URLs, and valid response metadata. | Multisite smoke asserts the feed status, content type, Site home URL, and exact Listing count. | Live validity, item fields, ordering, and canonical agreement remain to be checked. |
| Redirect integrity | HTTP and route redirects preserve the intended canonical path without chains, loops, or retired origins. | Application routes include permanent Listing redirects and the deployment architecture owns apex/`www` routing. | A current live redirect inventory is missing. |
| Analytics presence | The configured Site analytics container loads without breaking Visitor behavior or leaking cross-Site identity. | Each Site has a distinct checked-in GTM ID and shared integration. | Consent expectations, live load, duplicate tags, and event correctness are unknown. |

## Quality properties

| Property | Expected behavior | Existing evidence | Evidence gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Availability | Critical public routes return the intended successful, redirect, or not-found status from the correct Worker. | Worker builds and local D1 browser smoke pass. | No agreed live route set, service objective, or automated post-deploy probe exists. |
| Accessibility | Core journeys are keyboard operable, semantically named, readable, and usable with reduced technical knowledge. | Tests use roles and accessible names for major controls; responsive interaction coverage exists. | No comprehensive automated accessibility scan or manual assistive-technology baseline exists. |
| Performance | Critical pages remain fast enough for Visitors and crawlers without excessive D1 work or asset weight. | D1 query benchmarks and warm-query production evidence exist. | No Visitor-centric Core Web Vitals or route performance budgets have been selected. |
| Responsive layout | Critical content and controls remain within the viewport at supported phone and desktop sizes. | Multisite smoke checks document and hero containment; public-parity covers mobile overlays. | Coverage does not yet include every critical page and long-content state. |
| Site isolation | A Site never displays another Site's catalog, metadata, analytics identity, or branding. | Separate D1 bindings/configuration plus tenant predicates and multisite tests enforce major boundaries. | A live cross-Site sentinel check and complete metadata/asset isolation proof are missing. |
| Safe degradation | Cache, optional content, or third-party failures do not corrupt public data or expose private state. | Catalog cache contracts fall back to live D1; public/private query boundaries are tested. | Visitor-visible behavior under dependency failures is not systematically exercised. |

## Intentional Site differences

- Each Site has its own name, domain, copy, analytics ID, social links, branding,
  categories, Listing set, and network-brand group.
- PVD has checked-in logo, favicon, and Open Graph assets; SERP currently uses shared
  or fallback branding behavior.
- PVD has an isolated preview Worker and D1 database. SERP's missing preview
  environment is a known platform gap and not permission to invent one implicitly.
- Both Sites currently enable Brands and newsletter surfaces and disable auth, docs,
  dedicated favorites, guides, projects, creator-projects, and external-resources
  surfaces.

## Existing automated evidence seams

- `apps/e2e/tests/multisite-smoke.spec.ts`: selected Site identity, exact D1 catalog,
  representative Listing/category/search behavior, canonical metadata, structured
  data, sitemap/feed contracts, and mobile containment.
- `apps/e2e/tests/public-parity.spec.ts`: desktop and mobile search, autocomplete,
  navigation, local favorites, sorting, empty states, and link semantics.
- `apps/e2e/tests/minimal.spec.ts` and `home.spec.ts`: basic route and document smoke.
- `scripts/architecture-guard.test.ts`: D1-only and forbidden architecture paths.
- `scripts/sitemap-files.test.ts`, `audit-sitemaps.test.ts`, and
  `submit-gsc-sitemaps.test.ts`: sitemap generation, audit, and Search Console
  operational contracts.
- `packages/data-ops/` tests and benchmark: public eligibility, projections,
  navigation, related Listings, caching, and bounded D1 query behavior.
- `pnpm harness:check`: documentation, architecture, D1 contracts, types, lint,
  repository tests, Worker configuration, and both Worker builds without deployment.

## Decisions still required

1. Which rows and properties are required to block a production release?
2. What constitutes sufficient local, preview, and live evidence for each required
   capability?
3. Which accessibility and performance thresholds are release-blocking?
4. How should SERP releases compensate for the absence of an isolated preview?
5. Which live checks run before deployment, immediately afterward, and continuously?
6. What rollback or traffic response follows a failed post-deployment invariant?
