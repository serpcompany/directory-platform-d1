# D1 replacement cutover record

Status: completed on 2026-09-25

Governing issue: [#72](https://github.com/serpcompany/directory-platform-d1/issues/72)

Final commit: `11813bb73facaeece37acbe56c9e09018c944867`

This is the retained operational record for the completed legacy-to-Drizzle D1
cutover. It is not an instruction to rerun the migration. The one-time preparation,
provisioning, Preview rehearsal, Production cutover, rollback, and finalization
workflows are disabled in GitHub Actions.

## Active identities

| Site and environment | Worker | Active Drizzle D1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SERP Preview | `serp-software-replatform-preview` | `serp-software-replatform-preview` (`29c0a6ed-e824-459c-b088-6098fdbf1abf`) |
| SERP Production | `serp-software-production` | `serp-software-replatform-production` (`7d525a45-318b-4227-9463-19f4e9cb6eb6`) |
| PVD Preview | `pornvideodownloaders-preview` | `pornvideodownloaders-replatform-preview` (`16ede356-3caa-4cea-93f3-69f5b208b1d7`) |
| PVD Production | `pornvideodownloaders-production` | `pornvideodownloaders-replatform-production` (`8f5097c5-7c11-4505-bc59-b41cb4c86100`) |

Routine protected releases must explicitly select `D1_RELEASE_GENERATION=replatform`,
the replacement identity secrets, replacement Wrangler templates, and `d1/drizzle/`.
The inactive source identities are never routine release targets.

Both exact-main Preview rehearsals proved fresh schema application, exact parity,
repeat import no-op, Catalog journeys, isolated Submission journeys, rollback and
restoration, sealed receipts, and transient-authority cleanup. Both Production runs
captured one stable locked 17-table snapshot, imported and verified exact parity,
rehearsed immutable-version rollback, restored the target version, and retained
90-day evidence. Finalization revalidated the active target and unlocked only that
replacement database.

## Retained source databases

The former Production databases are unbound from every Worker, remain locked, and
must not be repurposed or deleted before the recorded evidence expires:

| Site | Retained source | Minimum retention deadline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SERP | `serp-software-directory-db` (`dda690b0-19c1-4d7e-a3c8-da2a9e3216a8`) | `2026-12-24T09:15:12Z` |
| PVD | `pornvideo-downloaders-production` (`d934a6c2-b382-4c50-a220-1e9dc0e5f8e5`) | `2026-12-24T09:26:48Z` |

The historical `d1/migrations/0001`-`0009` lineage, cutover receipts, source/target
exports, and source identity secrets remain recovery evidence until that deadline.

## Recovery boundary

The checked-in rollback workflow is not directly executable after finalization:
it requires both cutover locks to be active, while finalization marked the active
replacement lock successful. In addition, writes may now exist only in the active
replacement database. Do not present a Worker-version rollback to the retained source
as a safe live rollback and do not bypass the workflow's lock checks.

If recovery is required, first freeze all writes, determine whether post-cutover
writes exist, review the retained exports and receipts, and design a separately
reviewed forward recovery or replay. Production D1 queries, restores, binding changes,
and deletions still require explicit protected authorization.

## Deferred cleanup

After both retention deadlines:

1. verify current Worker bindings and routes account-wide;
2. confirm retained artifacts and any required export have been preserved;
3. confirm no workflow or environment consumes the source identities;
4. obtain separate approval for each exact database deletion;
5. delete only the approved sources and record Cloudflare receipts; and
6. remove the retired lineage, cutover-only code, environment values, and workflows
   in a reviewed pull request.

The two unbound source Preview databases were deleted through the protected,
main-only `delete-retired-preview-d1.yml` workflow after explicit authorization:

- `serp-software-replatform-source-preview`
  (`5e96a9f0-e11a-4c60-8dd3-02299c032466`):
  [run 36124973769](https://github.com/serpcompany/directory-platform-d1/actions/runs/36124973769),
  export and receipts retained through `2026-12-24T10:37:28Z`;
- `pornvideo-downloaders-preview` (`f92694b0-af7d-4c13-91f2-ee0393af9bdd`):
  [run 36125338098](https://github.com/serpcompany/directory-platform-d1/actions/runs/36125338098),
  export and receipts retained through `2026-12-24T10:41:30Z`.

Both final receipts record `action=deleted`; account inventory and public HTTP checks
re-proved the active replacement Preview databases and Worker bindings afterward.
The temporary OAuth and retired Preview identity secrets were removed, and the
deletion workflow was disabled. This grants no authority over either retained
Production source, which remains governed by Issue #88 and the deadlines above.
