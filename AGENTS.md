# Repository contract for coding agents

This repository operates the production `serp.software` and `pornvideodownloaders.com` directories as isolated Next.js OpenNext Workers backed by distinct Cloudflare D1 databases. D1 is the only catalog database.

## Start here

Read in this order:

1. [Architecture](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for stable responsibilities and boundaries.
2. [Data model](./docs/DATA_MODEL.md) for D1 ownership and publication rules.
3. [Development](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the local loop.
4. [Harness](./docs/HARNESS.md) for validation, runtime evidence, and worktrees.
5. [Migration SOP](./docs/MIGRATION_SOP.md) before examining a legacy JSON-directory site.
6. [Deploy runbook](./docs/DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md) before any Cloudflare operation.

## Repository map

- `apps/<site-id>/`: site-specific Next.js routes and OpenNext Worker boundary.
- `apps/<site-id>/lib/catalog/`: server-only adapter that acquires and validates the
  site's D1 binding.
- `sites/<site-id>/`: checked-in presentation and route configuration.
- `configs/wrangler/<site-id>/`: checked-in local, preview, and production Worker
  templates.
- `.wrangler/generated/`: ignored, environment-specific Worker configuration
  materialized by protected release tooling.
- `d1/drizzle/`: fresh history; `d1/migrations/`: immutable `0001`-`0009` legacy history.
- `d1/publications/`: reviewed ongoing catalog mutation manifests.
- `d1/artifacts/`: immutable initial-bootstrap and parity evidence.
- `packages/web-core/`: shared page, navigation, search, sitemap, and RSS behavior.
- `packages/data-ops/`: shared, explicitly site-bound catalog DTOs, D1 queries,
  caching contracts, and safe query telemetry.
- `scripts/harness/`: deterministic agent feedback and runtime tooling.
- `scripts/migration/`: read-only legacy source inspection.
- `scripts/site-targets.ts`: exhaustive active-site identities and release targets.
- `.agents/skills/`: progressively disclosed repeatable agent workflows.
- `docs/`: repository-local source of truth and operating procedures.

Closer `AGENTS.md` files add local rules without replacing this contract.

## Agent skills
Repository-specific [issue-tracker](./docs/agents/issue-tracker.md),
[triage-label](./docs/agents/triage-labels.md), and [domain-doc](./docs/agents/domain.md)
configuration lives under `docs/agents/`; installed skills own their general workflows.

## Primary commands

- `pnpm harness:fast`: docs, architecture, D1 contracts, and type boundaries.
- `pnpm harness:check`: the full non-deployment validation loop.
- `pnpm docs:check`: documentation links, indexes, commands, and skill contracts.
- `pnpm agent:manifest`: machine-readable local runtime and binding information.
- `pnpm agent:doctor`: prerequisite and isolation diagnostics.
- `pnpm agent:dev`: logged, isolated local D1 Worker preview.
- `pnpm agent:pornvideodownloaders:dev`: second-site local Worker preview.
- `pnpm worktree:new -- <name>`: create an isolated `codex/<name>` worktree.
- `pnpm worktree:destroy -- <name>`: safely remove a registered harness worktree.
- `pnpm migration:preflight -- ...`: read-only legacy site inventory.

Default root aliases select `serp.software` explicitly. Named `*:pornvideodownloaders*` aliases select `pornvideodownloaders.com`; lower-level multisite commands require `--site <site-id>` and reject missing or unknown sites.

## Planning and implementation

GitHub Issues are the source of truth for active planning and execution.

- For a clear substantial change, use `to-spec` to publish the PRD, then
  `to-tickets` to create independently verifiable vertical slices with explicit
  blocking relationships.
- For a large effort whose decisions are not yet clear, use `wayfinder` to maintain
  a GitHub map and decision tickets. Convert the settled result into a spec and
  implementation tickets.
- Implement one ready ticket at a time with `implement`; use a short-lived branch,
  the repository harness, `code-review`, and a required-check pull request into
  protected `main`. Never push directly or force-push to `main`.
- Record acceptance evidence, operational results, recovery details, and residual
  risks on the governing issue or ticket.
- Issues and labels never grant production, database, deployment, deletion, or other
  external-mutation authority. The deploy runbook's confirmation gates still apply.

## Non-negotiable architecture

- Read listings and categories through `apps/<site-id>/lib/catalog/repository.ts`;
  that adapter must delegate catalog SQL to `packages/data-ops/`.
- Add or optimize public catalog queries once in `packages/data-ops/`; never copy
  catalog SQL into a site application.
- Add every executable site to `scripts/site-targets.ts`; never infer a default.
- Obtain the database only through the server-only OpenNext `DB` binding.
- Fail closed when the D1 binding or `D1_RUNTIME_ENV` is missing or invalid.
- Parse untrusted input at its boundary and pass precise values inward.
- Use prepared statements and bind every runtime value.
- Model tables in `packages/data-ops/src/schema.ts`; generate fresh history under
  `d1/drizzle/`. Never rewrite or scan legacy `d1/migrations/0001`-`0009` into it.
- Add reviewed data changes as YAML manifests under `d1/publications/`.
- Keep search, taxonomy, RSS, sitemap, and submission options derived from D1.
- Preserve each site's separate local and production identities. Preserve PVD's
  preview identity; SERP's missing preview environment is a known follow-up and must
  not be invented during unrelated work.
- Route production mutations through protected GitHub Actions only.

## Forbidden patterns

Do not add a catalog JSON/YAML/CSV runtime, generated browser search index, filesystem
fallback, static-directory build, GitHub Pages deploy path, or default/starter
directory implementation. Do not add catalog files named `listings.json`,
`products.json`, `categories.json`, or `search-index.json`.

Do not treat migration source files as application inputs. The migration preflight is
read-only and external-source-only. Never copy legacy catalog files into this repo.

The SQL under `d1/artifacts/` is immutable bootstrap evidence, not an authoring
format. Never regenerate an existing artifact from a catalog file.

## Completion contract

Run targeted checks while editing and `pnpm harness:check` before claiming a
substantial change is complete. For runtime behavior, also capture the relevant
Playwright or live-route evidence. Read the diff, preserve unrelated user changes,
and report residual risks.

Production database or Worker operations require the confirmations and protected
environments in [the deploy runbook](./docs/DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md). A passing local
harness never grants deployment authority.
